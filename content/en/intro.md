Welcome
=======

I was first introduced to the computer/internet when I was 11 years old watching my Dad build his own website on MS FrontPage. Ever since then, I knew what I wanted to do in life: Make websites. Very soon, I was introduced to the concept of *Software Engineering* and I grew even more interested in technology. Now I am trying to use my skillset in web development and computer software to build something that solves people's problems.
