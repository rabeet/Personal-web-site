I am currently a graduate student at Florida Polytechnic University, pursuing a Master's degree in Innovation and Technology. I've been working as a research assitant under the supervision of Dr. Sherif Rashad. My thesis involves the design and implementation of a system to transliterate American Sign Language to Speech using wearable devices.
