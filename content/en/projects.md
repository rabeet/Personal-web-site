* I am looking to further my education in *Cloud Computing* and *Virtualization*. I also *love* to learn practically and currently I am looking more into AngularJS as well as advanced Ruby on Rails as I really like the concept of full-stack frameworks.  
* I am the core developer of [Praducks](http://praducks.com) which is a membership based service that allows its members to have regular household items shipped to them on a weekly/monthly basis while giving something back to minors who need help.  
* During college days I started a web-design and marketing company with a friend called [Simple Media Marketing](http://www.simplemediamarketing.net).
